# Video Processing with Noise and Watermark

## Description
This repository contains a Python project for processing video files using OpenCV and NumPy. The project reads a video file, adds salt-and-pepper noise to each frame, applies a watermark, and optionally applies a blur filter. The processed video is then saved to an output file. The project also includes visualization of singular values before and after watermarking.

## Features
- Reads video files and processes each frame.
- Adds salt-and-pepper noise to frames.
- Applies watermark to frames.
- Optionally applies blur filter to frames.
- Saves the processed video to an output file.
- Visualizes singular values of frames before and after watermarking.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
To process a video file using the script, follow these steps:

1. Place your input video file in the working directory.
2. Run the script with the specified input and output file paths.
